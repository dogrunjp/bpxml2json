N16961</B>.\nThis is an epidemic serogroup of <I>Vibrio cholerae</I> isolated in 1971 in Bangladesh and is distinguished from the classical biotype due to hemolysin production. It contains 2 chromosomes. The first, and larger chromosome, contains many essential cell functions, as well as virulence genes contained within pathogenicity islands (PAIs). One major pathogenicity determinant is encoded within a PAI that is contained inside an integrated phage (CTXphi) on chromosome 1 that codes for the cholera toxin, an adenylate cyclase. Once the toxin is injected into host cells, it results in secretion of chlorine ions, which leads to increased water secretion, dehydration, and eventually, death. Up to 20 litres of water a day may be lost. The second chromosome also has important cell functions, but has a preponderance of genes associated with energy and transport functions, including signal transduction systems, and in addition, DNA repair enzymes. Chromosome 2 also has the integron island, a large variable region of the chromosome that functions as a gene capture system, some of which are associated with antibiotic resistance. There are 105 genes that have copies on both chromosomes.\n",

            "description": "<b><i>Clostridium</b></i>. This genus comprises about 150 metabolically diverse species of anaerobes that are ubiquitous in virtually all anoxic habitats where organic compounds are present, including soils, aquatic sediments and the intestinal tracts of animals and humans. Characteristic of clostridia is the shape of their cells that resembles a drumstick or spindle ('kloster' is Greek for 'spindle'). This shape is attributed to the presence of endospores that develop under conditions unfavorable for vegetative growth and distend single cells terminally or sub-terminally. The endospores of many species are extremely sturdy and survive extended boiling in water and exposure to air. Spores germinate under conditions favorable for vegetative growth, such as anaerobiosis and presence of organic substrates. From the evolutionary perspective, clostridia are considered to be the most ancient bacteria. It is believed that present day <i>Mollicutes</i> (<i>Eubacteria</i>) have evolved regressively (i.e., by genome reduction) from gram-positive clostridia-like ancestors with a low GC content in DNA. Several species of clostridia (e.g., <i>C. perfringens</i>, <i>C. botulinum</i>, <i>C. tetani</i>) are known opportunistic toxin-producing pathogens in animals and humans. Some species are capable of producing organic solvents (acetone, ethanol, etc,), molecular hydrogen and other useful compounds. There are also species that can fix molecular nitrogen and thus are important participants in biological turnaround of nitrogen compounds in nature. \n<p> \n<i><b>Clostridium perfringens</i></b>. This organism is a causative agent of a wide spectrum of necrotic enterotoxicoses. In humans it is responsible for such diseases as gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), food poisoning, necrotizing enterocolitis of infants and enteritis necroticans (pigbel). It also causes such animal diseases as lamb dysentery, ovine enterotoxemia (struck), pulpy kidney disease in lambs and other enterotoxemias in lambs and calves. \n<p> \nThe bacterium is one of the most widely distributed pathogens in nature. It is commonly found in the environment (soil, sewage) and in the animal and human gastrointestinal tract as a member of the normal microflora. It is a fast growing (generation time 8-10 min) anaerobic flesh-eater. Active fermentative growth is accompanied by profuse generation of molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Unlike most other clostridia, <i>C. perfringens</i> is non-motile. It is also oxygen tolerant which makes it an easy object to work with in laboratories. Systems for genetic manipulation of <i>C. perfringens</i> have been developed and the species became a model organism in clostridial genetic studies. \n<p> \nKnown isolates belong to five distinct types (A, B, C, D, and E) that are distinguished based on the specific extracellular toxins they produce. Each of the toxins is responsible for a specific disease syndrome. Type A strains that cause gas gangrene produce toxin alpha (phospholypase C), theta (hemolysin), kappa (collagenase), mu (hyaluronidase), nu (DNAse) and neuraminidase which are all the enzymatic factors aiding the bacterium in invading and destruction of the host tissues.\n<p>\n<i><b>Clostridium perfringens</i> str. 13</b>. This strain is a type A isolate from the soil. It can establish gas gangrene in a murine experimental model.\n<p>",

This organism appears to live in a rich environment as it encodes a large number of transporters, both for import and export, of complex substrates such as carbohydrates, including a type II secretion system that may be used to export extracellular enzymes for degradation of biopolymers.

The assembly is a combination of the maternal and paternal haplotypes, which differ by about 1.2%. The assembly contains 116.7 million base pairs of nonrepetitive sequence, which represents about 75% of the <i>C. intestinalis</i> genome. It is estimated that 95% of protein-coding genes are contained in the assembly. Version 2 of the assembly is available at <a href=\"http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Cioin2/Cioin2.home.html\">JGI</a> but it has not been submitted to GenBank.</p>",

Three different type III secretion systems (TTSS) are encoded on the chromosomes of this organism, two of which are similar to plant pathogenic TTSSs, while the third is similar to the <i>Salmonella</i> pathogenicity island, all of which may contribute to pathogenicity. Other virulence determinants include multidrug efflux pumps, secreted toxins and proteases, and various adhesins. Capsular polysaccharide may protect the organism from host defense mechanisms. This organism also carries a number of small sequence repeats which may promoter antigenic variation, similar to what was found with the <i>B. mallei</i> genome.",

Each chromosome was individually shotgun cloned, assembled, and annotated. The six chromosomes of this organism encode approximately 12,500 predicted proteins, a large proportion of which have long stretches of repetitive amino acid sequences. In addition to the nuclear genome, <i>D. discoideum</i> has a 55-kb mitochondrial genome and several copies of extrachromosomal elements that contain the rDNA genes. </p>\n\n<p>The <i>D. discoideum</i> strain AX4 whole genome shotgun (WGS) project has the accession <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=nuccore&cmd=Search&term=AAFI00000000\">AAFI00000000</a>.

First, the genome size of cultivated oat is approximately 16000 Mbp. This is more than five times larger than human, with the associated technical difficulties encountered during the Human Genome Initiative. Second, cultivated oat is an allopolyploid of three component genomes - a hexaploid. This fact only partially accounts for the size difference between oat and human. Third, financial support for such an effort, with the obligatory prior development of reagents and a knowledge-base, is directly related to agronomic importance, whether measured in acres under cultivation, bushels produced annually, or pecuniary value of that produced. By any of these criteria, oat in the United States is far behind the other grasses - wheat, barley, corn, and rice.</P>\n<P>\nThe reduced financial support noted above has been a long-standing feature of cultivated oat research with the consequence of being an impediment to producing genetic maps. The other impediment is a collection of technical conditions. First, in the hexaploid strains translocations between the chromosomes of the component genomes disrupt the ability to presume homosequential gene order among the genomes or between the diploid strains to the hexaploid genomes. Second, only recently has a complete aneuploid series been developed. This reagent enables overcoming the limited ability to discrimate chromosomes on the basis of morphology and has allowed the assignment of the homoeologous groupings. Reducing the barrier imposed by the technical impediments has been the elucidation of \"anchor probes\", DNA probes for loci that are common to a number of the agronomically important grasses (VanDeynze et al. Theor Appl Genet 1998; 97: 356-369). \n",

Bread wheat has a large genome and its hexaploid nature has delayed the sequencing of its genome. To understand the genome, in 1989, the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) was established to develop RFLP maps for members of Triticeae, especially wheat and barley and make them publicly available. In 1998 the International Triticeae EST Cooperative (ITEC) was established to create a public database of ESTs in order to study the wheat functional genomics. This led to the establishment of NSF funded <a href=\"http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/NSF/htmlversion.html\">Wheat Genome Project</a> in US to generate large scale wheat ESTs and to map all these genes to chromosomes. <a href=\"http://www.cerealsdb.uk.net/igf.htm\">BBSRC</a> funded Gene Function Initiative (GFI) project in UK has also developed resources for investigating cereal gene function. \n<p>\n<i>Triticum aestivum</i> has a genome size of about 16000 Mb with 21 chromosomes.

Like all microsporidia, <i>E. cuniculi</i> lacks mitochondria, infects the host with a polar filament and survives as microsporidia outside the host.\n\n<p>Although microsporidia were once thought to have evolved from an ancient eukaryotic lineage before the acquisition of mitochondria, there is growing evidence that they are more related to fungi. Analysis of the <i>E. cuniculi</i> genome supports this fungal association: it contains genes of putative mitochondrial origin, suggesting that <i>E. cuniculi</i> has retained a mitochondrion-derived organelle, and phylogenetic studies of several genes placed <i>E. cuniculi</i> sister to fungi or within the fungal Kingdom.\n\n<p><i>E. cuniculi</i> has one of the smallest known eukaryotic genomes, approximately 2.9 Mb. Its genome is organized in 11 chromosomes and has approximately 2,000 predicted protein-encoding genes. \n\n\n",

Occasionally the fungus can infect apparently healthy individuals. Cryptococcal disease is acquired via inhalation of haploid yeast or basidiospores from the environment.\n\nGenus <i>Filobasidiella</i> contains approximately 38 <i>Cryptococcus</i> species. A few are pathogenic and constitute the pathogenic <i>Cryptococcus</i>  species cluster. Two of the species, <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> and <i>Cryptococcus bacillisporus</i>, are the casual agents of the majority of human and animal <a href=\"http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001328.htm\">cryptococcosis</a>.\n\n<p> This genus typically reproduces asexually as haploid, encapsulated budding yeast, but may also be dispersed by means of sexually produced basidiospores. Its mating type locus (MAT) contains more than 20 genes. Usually MAT-a and MAT-alpha cells are involved in mating. However same-sex mating between two MAT-alpha cells has also been observed. Sexual reproduction can play an important role in contributing to virulence of the pathogen. \n\n<p> Based on the differences in capsule polysaccharides, <i>Cryptococcus</i> is traditionally subdivided into 5 serotypes - A, B, C, D and AD. The polysaccharide capsule protects the fungus from the host's immune system and is considered a key factor in determining the virulence of cryptococcal infections and disease. Another characteristic that can be used to subdivide the Cryptococcus species is unique molecular types (genotypes).\n\n<p>There are two varieties of <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> recognized: <i>C. neoformans var. grubii</i>, serotype A and <i>C. neoformans var. neoformans</i>, serotype D.

            "description": "<i>Ustilago maydis</i>, also known as <i>Ustilago zeae</i>, is a basidiomycete fungus that usually exists as a filamentous mycelium in nature. Unlike typical basidiomycetes, it does not have a real fruiting body. During its life cycle it produces a large sac containing resting, diploid teliospores. These spores germinate and form haploid basidiospores by meiosis. Haploid hyphae of opposite mating type can fuse and form a filamentous, dikaryotic cell type. The haploid <i>Ustilago maydis</i> genome is approximately 20.5 Mb, organized in 23 chromosomes.\n\n<p><i>Ustilago maydis</i> is the causal agent of corn smut disease. \nThis fungal pathogen infects growing maize and teosinte plants, leading to the formation of large tumor-like masses filled with spores, stunted plant growth, and reduced crop yield. Corn smut disease causes severe damage and losses of corn, one of the world's major cereal crops, every year. However, in Mexico and Central America, corn smut is considered a culinary delicacy (huitlacoche).\n\n<p><i>Ustilago maydis</i> is an excellent model system for studying host-pathogen interactions, and it has been studied for more than 100 years by plant pathologists. This organism can be cultured easily under laboratory conditions on young corn plants and on synthetic media, where it grows as a single-celled yeast. It is amenable to molecular manipulations, such as transformation and homologous gene replacement. Molecular genetic research with <i>Ustilago maydis</i> focuses on signaling pathways that influence virulence, the role of mating in pathogenesis, and recombination (the Holliday junction, a DNA recombinant structure, was first observed in this species). Recently, the fungus has emerged as an excellent experimental model for the molecular genetic analysis of phytopathogenesis, particularly in the characterization of infection-specific morphogenesis in response to signals from host plants. <i>Ustilago maydis</i> also serves as an important model for other basidiomycete plant pathogens that are more difficult to work with in the laboratory, such as the rust and bunt fungi. The genomic sequence of <i>Ustilago maydis</i> will be valuable in comparative analyses with other fungal genomes, especially for understanding the host range of fungal phytopathogens. It will also aid in identifying molecular targets for the development of antifungal drugs. The analysis of <i>Ustilago maydis</i> will provide a framework for studying the hundreds of other <i>Ustilago</i> species that attack important crops, such as barley, wheat, sorghum, and sugarcane. \n",

The most significant difference between the genome of <I>E. ruminantium</I> and those of the other Rickettsiales is the presence of a large number of repetitive sequences. These repeats make up 8.5% of the genome and consist of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), large tandem repeats, and dispersed repeats. These repeats are associated with 29 of the 32 pseudogenes which appear to have occured primarily through duplication events. In addition, it is thought that the SSRs may play a role in regulation or phase variation. Between 10-15% of the genes in free-living bacteria are thought to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Intracellular bacteria have limited exposure to other bacteria and therefore a smaller portion of their genome is from other organisms. It is estimated that only 3% of the genome of <I>E. ruminantium</I> has been obtained by gene transfer.

This organism is an extremely invasive serovar that is increasingly becoming resistant to multiple antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, which severly inhibits the treatment of systemic infections caused by this organism. This strain was isolated from a 58-year old man with sepsis and has been shown to be resistant to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. Mutations in the gyrase and topoisomerase genes appear to be the cause of the ciprofloxacin resistance while the presence of an <i>ampC</i> gene on a transmissable plasmid was responsible for ceftriaxone resistance. This organism also causes severe disease (swine paratyphoid) in pigs.\n",

They have an eel-like body shape with a well-defined mouth and tail. Most are semitransparent. They occur all around the world in both temperate and tropical waters.\n<p>\nLancelets share a number of features in common with vertebrates, including a dorsal nerve cord that is supported by a stiff rod known as the notochord (a forerunner of the backbone); a system of pharyngeal slits between the mouth and stomach, used to strain food particles from water; and a series of segmented, V-shaped muscles along the torso.\n<p>\nMany scientists believe that vertebrates may have evolved from an early ancestor similar to lancelets.

Cytological examination of parental strains indicated that each have four chromosomes. A total of 112 random ascospore progeny were analyzed for 122 genetic loci; 110 of the markers exhibited Mendelian inheritance. \n<P>\nGenetic markers consist of single nucleotide polymorphisms (n=66), RFLPs (n= 29), and microsatellites (n=27). Most SNPs and RFLPs were identified by sequencing alleles derived from EST loci for both parental strains; others were based on sequences at the ends of smaller scaffolds. One EST-based marker (HK235) and a marker based on the major ribosomal RNA repeat were not represented in the assembly but both map to linkage group 9 on chromosome 4. Microsatellites were obtained from a genome-wide scan for simple tandem repeats by the method of Benson (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=9862982\">Nucleic Acids Res. 27:573-580, 1999</a>) and then used for polymorphism screening at selected loci. \n\n",

It is not pathogenic for humans or animals. However, this organism was originally isolated (1984) from the gills of a fresh-water fish, the tench. It is the first mycoplasmal isolate that colonizes an aquatic organism. The unusual habitat explains lower temperature growth optimum of 20 degrees Celsius. <i>M. mobile</i> can glide at speeds of up to 7 microns/sec, much faster that any other known gliding mycoplasmas. Investigation of the fast gliding motility phenomenon was a primary driver for sequencing this genome.\n",

They are of significant agricultural and biological importance as many of the legume species are rich sources of protein and oil and can also fix atmospheric nitrogen. \n<p>\n<i>L. japonicus</i> has become a model plant for genome studies in legumes, particularly in reference to rhizobial and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Small genome size of about 470 Mb, diploid genome with 6 haploid chromosomes and a short life cycle of about 2 to 3 months makes it a convenient plant to study. <b>Kazusa DNA Research Institute</b> in Japan, is presently the only institute involved in sequencing its genome. They initially sequenced the genome of <i>Mesorhizobium loti</i>, an endosymbiont associated with <i>L. japonicus</i> and then started sequencing the host genome. They also initiated the sequencing of ESTs and created high-density linkage maps of all six chromosomes. Data is available from the  <a href=\"http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus\">Kazusa</a> web site.\n<p>\n<i>L. japonicus</i> does have several similar characteristics  to the legume <i>Medicago truncatula</i> which is being sequenced by a consortium of laboratories in US and Europe, but they are phylogenetically different and exhibit two different development systems for nodulation.\n",

Although a food staple in many regions of the world, most is used for animal feed and ethanol fuel. Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.\n The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).",

They are considered paleopolyploids with all species having a haploid chromosome number of 19. <i>Populus trichocarpa</i> is a hardy, fast growing tree that can be propagated vegetatively. It has been chosen as a model plant for tree genomics because of its small genome size, rapid juvenile growth, ease of clonal propagation, high-throughput transformation and regeneration, and availability of extensive genetic maps. <b><i>Populus</i></b> genome will therefore be the first tree genome to be sequenced.

            "description": "<i>S. bicolor</i> is native to Africa and is grown throughout the world.  <i>Sorghum</i> is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world and third in the United States. It exhibits C4 photosynthetic pathway. It is one of the most drought-tolerant crop that grows well in semiarid regions. It exhibits a deep root system and thick leaf wax. Both traits are thought to help it survive hot dry conditions. Some members of this genus are weeds but the domesticated varieties are used as human food and fodder. Certain varieties are sweet where grain and stem are used for making syrup, jaggery and sugar. Sorghum is also an interesting model to study drought tolerance as it is known to grow even if water becomes limiting showing a \"stay-green\" phenotype. \n<p>\nSorghum has a small genome size of about 760 Mb with 2n=20 chromosomes, which falls between the genomes of rice (~420 Mb) and that of the other crops with a larger and more complex genome. The assembled chromosome pseudomolecules were submitted to NCBI in June 2009. The RefSeq records were created July 2009.\n",

            "description": " <p><i>Ornithorhynchus anatinus</i>, or duck-billed platypus, is an important model organism for developmental, evolutionary, and genomic studies. The platypus and two species of echidna comprise the monotremes (prototherian mammals). Monotremes diverged from therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) approximately 210 million years ago and, not surprisingly, retain a mixture of reptilian and mammalian features. Monotremes are best known for their mixture of primitive and derived reproductive traits. For example, monotremes lay eggs but also have mammary glands. In platypus, eggs are nourished in the uterus for approximately 28 days and then externally incubated for 10 days. As in birds and other reptiles, the platypus karyotype consists of a few macrochromosomes and many microchromosomes. Platypus have 52 chromosomes. Males are heterogametic with 21 paired chromosomes and 10 unpaired chromosomes (X1-5 and Y1-5). During meiosis these unpaired chromosomes form a linked chain of elements. Though the sex determination system of monotremes is still incompletely understood it offers tantalizing clues to the ancestral sex determination system of birds and placental mammals.</p>\n",

The chicken is an important agricultural animal and has served as a model organism in many areas of biomedical research; it is one of the primary models for embryology and development, the study of viruses, and cancer. The chicken genome is less than half the size of that of mouse or human, and consists of 38 autosomes and two sex chromosomes, referred to as Z and W.  Unlike mammals, male birds are homozygous (ZZ) while females are heterozygous (ZW).  Chicken chromosomes, like other avian species, exhibit a much greater variation in size ranging from 200 Mb to 5 Mb; the smaller chromosomes are termed \"microchromosomes\".",

            "description": "<B><I>Bacillus thuringiensis</I></B>. This organism, also known as BT, is famous for the production of an insecticidal toxin. The bacterium was initially discovered as a pathogen of various insects and was first used as an insecticidal agent in the early part of this century. This organism, like many other Bacilli, is found in the soil, where it leads a saprophytic existence, but becomes an opportunistic pathogen of insects when ingested. The specific activity of the toxin towards insects and its lack of toxicity to animals has made this organism a useful biocontrol agent.  The delta-endotoxin, which is produced during the sporulation part of the life cycle, causes midgut paralysis and disruption of feeding by the infected insect host. The presence of a parasporal crystal, which is outside the exosporium of the endospore, is indicative of production of the toxin, and serves as a marker for this species.\n<P>\nActivation of the toxin typically requires a high pH environment such as the alkaline environments in insect midguts followed by proteolysis. Binding of the toxin to a receptor on intestinal epithelial cells serves to position the toxin to insert itself into the apical membrane where it forms a pore. The flux of water and ions into the cytoplasm results in eventual lysis leading to tissue damage. Various toxin genes specific for a variety of insects have been studied, and many are now being used in genetically modified plants which have been engineered to produce the toxin themselves, eliminating the need to produce sufficient amounts of <I>B. thuringiensis</I> spores.\n<P>\n<B><I>Bacillus thuringiensis</I> subsp.<I> konkukian</I> serotype H34 strain 97-27</B>. This organism was isolated from a case of severe human tissue necrosis which is unusual since human infections by this organism are rare.

The previous WGS project, CABZ00000000, is assembly WGS31 and represents the whole genome assembled from Illumina and Sanger shotgun reads. The latest project replaces WGS with high quality finished clone sequence, closing remaining gaps and placing yet unlocalized sequence. \n\n<p>The Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) has taken over maintenance of the zebrafish assembly. The goals of this group are to correct regions that are misrepresented, to close remaining gaps, and to produce alternative assemblies of structurally variant loci. The consortium does experimental work to address gaps or sub-optimal sequence regions and has developed the infrastructure to review and curate assembly joins.  The GRC consists of: The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, The Genome Center at Washington University, The European Bioinformatics Institute and The National Center for Biotechnology Information.

They do share almost the same reduced set of coding functions but exhibit several differences, like, completely different gene order, presence of an additional gene for tRNA(met) that may be a pseudogene, transcription of all genes from the same mtDNA strand, a lower G + C content, less pronounced bias in codon usage and the absence of a reverse transcriptase-like gene homologue.

They are usually found in pairs, interpreted as two-celled colonies. Cells range from ovate to narrowly ellipsoidal. Each cell has two flagella of unequal length at the anterior end. They contain one centrally-located nucleus and, usually, two plate-like, parietal, golden-colored chloroplasts that do not contain pyrenoids. Cells in stationary phase may develop a reddish pigmentation. \n<p>\nThe mitochondrial genome of <b><i>Chrysodidymus synuroideus</b></i> has been sequenced. It is  34,119 bp circular molecule that contains 58 genes.

These are brown, photosynthetic and filamentous algae where the thallus is composed of uniseriate filaments. They are diplohaplontic, having a haploid and diploid generations. They exhibit simple cytological characteristics consisting of peripheral plastids and a central nucleus. <p>In order to understand the evolution of the mitochondrial genomes, mitochondria of <b><i> P. littoralis</b></i> has been completely sequenced. It showed the presence of several alpha-proteobacterial characteristics and the presence of several other rarer genes.\n\n",

The cells are ovoid or spherical and can be found in groups forming branched filaments that are connected by hyaline tubes. Each cell has a parietal chloroplast, which contains a pyrenoid, and it bears a long hair like structure that is formed by extension of the cell wall that has a basal sheath. Oogamous reproduction has been reported and asexual reproduction is by the formation of biflagellate zoospores. <b><i>Chaetosphaeridium</b></i> belongs to the order <b><i>Choleochaetales</b></i> which has great evolutionary and environmental importance as it has often been thought of as the group closest to the land plants.\n<p>\nMitochondrial and chloroplast genome of <b><i>Chaetosphaeridium globosum</b></i>  has been fully sequenced in order to understand the evolution of organelle genomes in Streptophyta.  Chloroplast DNA (131,183 bp) was found to be strikingly similar to land-plant DNA in terms of gene content (124 genes), intron composition (18 introns), and gene order, while the mitochondrial DNA (56,574 bp) was found to be more compact than land plants and featured differences at the levels of size, intron composition (11 introns), and gene order. \n\n",
